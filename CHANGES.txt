 Mistakenly removed ``__parent__`` and ``__name__`` attributes from
 folder implementation, making 0.3 a brownbag.

 Backwards Incompatibilities

  - When a new object is added using ``__setitem__`` with the same
    name as an existing object, a KeyError is now raised rather than
    the item being silently replaced.

  - API methods accepting a ``name`` (``__setitem__``,
    ``__getitem__``, ``get``, ``__contains__``, and ``__delitem__``)
    now attempt to decode bytestrings to Unicode using the utf-8
    encoding before performing the action the method implies.

  - Previously, it was possible to store either an ASCII bytestring or
    a Unicode object as a key value.  Now all key values are converted
    to Unicode before being stored.
